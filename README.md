# DiabetesPrediction

This is an end to end project on Diabetes prediction using Catboost and Random Forest Classification Models. I have used Flask app as the means to deploy it.
The source of the data is available in this link - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset
